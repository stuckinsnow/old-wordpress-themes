# Clear 1.0 
Contributors: Philip

Requires at least: WordPress 4.4

Tested up to: WordPress 4.5 

# Description 
This theme was built by me in about 2019, and will likely not function at all. I am uploading it because I really liked the menu I designed. My code quality in this is beyond extremely poor, and the CSS is a mess. This is not an example of my work but rather to be used as proof I have dabbled in web development over the years.
