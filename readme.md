### Description 

These are four themes, three of which were modified from templates, made in 2019. This is not an example of the quality of my work today; I did not follow tutorials when I made these.

# Note 

These themes are not representative of my code quality tdoay; the code in these is beyond extremely poor--the CSS is particularly messy. I did write some of the PHP and jQuery e.g. [jQuery Launch File](https://github.com/stuckinsnow/old-wordpress-themes/blob/main/WordPress%20-%20Theme%202/js/jquery.launch.js), [Page Portfolio File](https://github.com/stuckinsnow/old-wordpress-themes/blob/main/WordPress%20-%20Theme%203/page-portfolio.php) and [Functions File](https://github.com/stuckinsnow/old-wordpress-themes/blob/main/WordPress%20-%20Theme%201/functions.php) but it was mostly from copying and pasting, without a true understanding. 

### Requirements

Requires at least: WordPress 4.4

Tested up to: WordPress 4.5
